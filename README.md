# Webblocker
A tiny little program for Linux to Block the internet access for a chosen amount of time. Get productive and don't waste your time online!

Currently, Webblocker only works with Zenity and only if you are using NetworkManager as your Internet-service.
It also works in a rather "stupid" way, so that it is very easy to unlock the internet Acces while the Blocking-mode is on. The effect of "Webblocker" is therefore more Psychological. Anyway, it helps me to stay focused on my work for a while and maybe it can be useful for you as well.
