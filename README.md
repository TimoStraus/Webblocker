# Webblocker
A GUI Program for Linux to block the internet Access for a chosen amount of time. This makes you more productive.

Currently, Webblocker only works for Kubuntu and only if you are using NetworkManager as your Internet-service.
It also works in a rather "stupid" way, so that it is very easy to unlock the internet Acces while the Blocking-mode is on. The effect of "Webblocker" is therefore more Psychological. Anyway, it helps me to stay focused on my work for a while and maybe it can be useful for you as well.

This is a test for a pull request.
